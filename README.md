## Introduction

### About

Aeternum API is a lightweight SaaS tool designed to continuously test API availability
and correctness. With a simple configuration, users can define their API endpoints,
expected HTTP status codes, and response times, ensuring their services remain operational
without manual monitoring.

Built using Golang, Aeternum API runs without requiring a database or external services;
this makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.

### Why Aeternum API?

✅ **Prevent Downtime**: Know immediately if your API behaves unexpectedly.
✅ **No Database Required**: Keep things simple and efficient.
✅ **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Go for high performance.
✅ **Automated Checks**: Define expected responses, and let Aeternum API do the rest.
✅ **B2C-Friendly**: Designed for developers, testers, and startups looking for a simple
    way to ensure API reliability.

## How It Works

Define a base URL for the API you want to test.
Specify endpoints with expected HTTP response codes.
Run Aeternum API to continuously verify your API's health.
