## Introduction

### About

Aeternum API is a lightweight SaaS tool designed to continuously test API availability
and correctness. With a simple configuration, users can define their API endpoints,
expected HTTP status codes, and response times, ensuring their services remain operational
without manual monitoring.

Built using Golang, Aeternum API runs without requiring a database or external services;
this makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.
