# About Aeternum

_Ensuring your APIs stand the test of time._

## Introduction

### What is Aeternum?

Aeternum API is a lightweight SaaS tool designed to continuously test API availability
and correctness. With a simple configuration, users can define their API endpoints,
expected HTTP status codes, and response times.

Built using Golang, Aeternum API runs without requiring a database or external services;
this makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.

### Why Aeternum API?

✅ **Prevent Downtime**: Know immediately if your API behaves unexpectedly.

✅ **No Database Required**: Keep things simple and efficient.

✅ **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Go for high performance.

✅ **Automated Checks**: Define expected responses, and let Aeternum API do the rest.

✅ **B2C-Friendly**: Designed for developers, testers, and startups looking for a simple
way to ensure API reliability.

### How It Works

1. Define a base URL for the API you want to test.
2. Specify endpoints with expected HTTP response codes.
3. Run Aeternum API to continuously verify your API's health.
